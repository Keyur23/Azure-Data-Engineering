# Azure Data Engineering 🌐

Welcome to the **Azure Data Engineering** repository! 🚀 In this repository, I have implemented various solutions utilizing **Azure** services to create a complete ETL pipeline. From data ingestion to transformation and analytics, this repository demonstrates the full lifecycle of data engineering on Azure.

## Overview 📊

This project showcases a data pipeline leveraging the following Azure services:

- **Data Source** 📥: The raw data is sourced from various datasets.
- **Data Ingestion** 🔄: Azure Data Factory (ADF) is used to orchestrate data ingestion processes.
- **Raw Data Storage** 💾: Data is stored in **Azure Data Lake Gen 2** for scalable and secure storage.
- **Data Transformation** 🔄: **Azure Databricks** is used for transforming the data using Spark.
- **Analytics** 📈: **Azure Synapse Analytics** is leveraged for powerful analytics and querying.
- **Visualization** 📊: **Power BI** is used to create insightful dashboards for reporting.

The entire process follows a typical **ETL** (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline pattern.
